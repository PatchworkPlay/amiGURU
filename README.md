# amiGURU
Personal studio manager for crocheting and knitting

Core Features: 

Reverse Engineering Tool

Upload an image → trace or auto-detect shapes → generate written + chart patterns.

Inventory Tracker

Yarn library with weights, colors, amounts in stock.

Alerts when you’re running low.

Shopping List Generator

Pattern requirements → compare with stash → output what’s missing.

Direct link to online shops (or preferred local yarn store).

Pattern Journal (digital + printable)

Auto-generated project “cards” like the Labubu template we just wrote.

Lets you mix typed + handwritten notes.

Flexibility

Planned Projects: minimize stress, cut unnecessary purchases.

Spontaneous Projects: leave room for “crochet a dolphin for the hell of it.” AmiGuru would know your stash, so you’d know instantly if you have enough yarn to play.

💡 The Bankruptcy → Agency Connection

Your Spain yarn story hits hard. That “I’ll never get this chance again” panic-purchase wasn’t just about yarn — it was about feeling like the future was closing in.

AmiGuru is the opposite:

It says: “You can plan. You do have agency. You can recreate joy without fear of scarcity.”

It builds confidence that you don’t need to hoard or overspend “just in case.”

It lets creativity happen without guilt.

🔮 Stretch Goal Ideas

Mood Crocheting: Pick a mood (calm, playful, stressed) → AmiGuru suggests projects from your stash that match.

Cross-platform journaling: Sync digital (GitHub, Obsidian, Google Docs) with physical (printable PDFs, index cards).

Community angle: optional sharing of generated patterns with others.

🧶 Analogy

It’s like going from “yarn stash chaos” → to a conductor’s score: every instrument (yarn ball, hook, pattern) has its part, but there’s still room for improvisation and solo riffs.
